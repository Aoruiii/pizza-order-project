# Pizza order app

Time-frame：Nov. 2023

## Overview

### Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to conveniently order pizza online. Designed by Jonas Schmedtmann and developed by me.

### My role

I am the Front-end Developer for the pizza ordering web app based on Jonas Schmedtmann's compelling design. Utilizing my expertise in React, JavaScript, JSX, HTML5, and Tailwind CSS, I coded the application. My focus was on creating an engaging user experience, ensuring every element of the UI was intuitive and responsive. Implementing features like a pizza menu, shopping cart and order creation and updates, I ensured the app was not only visually striking but also functional and user-friendly.

## Challenges

1. **Remote State Management**：Data Loading/Writing to get menu and create users/orders from RESTful APIs
2. **Seamless User Experience**: Well-designed error handling and loading experience between complicated page routes and data flow.

## Technologies Used

This is a Single-Page Appication(SPA) based on REACT, Javascript, JSX, HTML and CSS.
